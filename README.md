Problem Analysis:
A shopping bill is a detailed receipt that lists the items purchased at a store, along with their individual prices, quantities, and any applicable taxes or discounts. It serves as proof of the transaction and helps consumers keep track of their expenses. The total amount at the bottom of the bill reflects the overall cost of the items after any promotions or adjustments, and it often includes payment information or methods used to complete the purchase.

--------------------------

Use:

The provided C code can be used in various real-world applications, particularly in retail, grocery, and small business management systems where billing is a key feature. Here are some potential uses and scenarios where this code could be employed:
1. Retail Store Billing System:
The code can be used to process customer transactions in a retail or grocery store, where customers purchase multiple items. The program collects customer information, validates input (e.g., customer ID, mobile number), and computes the total bill, including taxes.
It can easily be adapted to work with point-of-sale (POS) terminals for quick customer checkouts.
2. Grocery Store:
A grocery store could use this code to generate bills for customers. The ability to input the number of items and their respective prices and quantities ensures that different types of products can be processed. Tax calculation based on a fixed tax rate (5%) also mirrors how taxes are handled in many countries or regions.
3. Small Business Applications:
Small businesses that sell physical goods could implement this code as part of their customer-facing billing systems. This might include convenience stores, local markets, or mobile vendors. The code offers a basic but effective way to track sales, customer data, and tax computations.
4. Shopping Apps or Websites:
The logic from this code can be integrated into a shopping website or app, where users can input their items, and the system calculates the total bill (including taxes) before generating a checkout summary. The customer details and purchase information could be extended to allow for order tracking, receipt generation, or payment processing.
5. Invoice Generation:
For businesses providing invoices for purchased goods, this code could be adapted to generate invoices with detailed customer information, itemized lists of purchased products, and a clear breakdown of tax and total amounts. This could be used in industries such as wholesale or business-to-business (B2B) transactions.
